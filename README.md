<p>
After opening a new ticket, you'll see Contact Information, Help Topic, and Ticket Details. This is where end users will fill out their information on what they need help with. For this example, we will be Jane Doe, and we need a password reset because we forgot it.

<p>
When we submitted our ticket for a password reset, this is what the Support Desk Technician sees. As you can probably tell, the information we provided as Jane is here.

<p>
Here you can see all the changes that were made to Jane's ticket. John assigned it to himself, changed the SLA, and altered the priority level of the ticket. After making all those changes, John responds to Jane to let her know that her password will be reset soon.

Finally, after successfully resetting Jane's password John reaches back out to let Jane know and closes the ticket.
